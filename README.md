## My create project for CSCI 101
### The overarching, most optimistic goal for this project is to:
Have a playable game of ultimate ultimate tic tac toe with both a single and 2 player versions. Along with having a very basic GUI implemented through either pygame (if it plays nice) or turtle. That will include a button to read the rules of the game, and selections for one or two player. In the game, it will automatically control who's turn it is, and which board you can play in. When the user clicks a square, the square will fill with their character (X or O)
### Things to keep in mind for optimization (because this could bet brute force-y really quickly and that wouldn't be great):
- When player plays on a board, check if there are <= 3 characters placed on that board. only then, check for a win on that board
- TBD
### Imagine thinking that I would do a single person version. No way no how I'm getting that done in time with everything else going on in this project and the rest of life.
